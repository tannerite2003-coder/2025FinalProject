    <h3>Man of Steel</h3>
    <p>
      Clark Kent is the mild-mannered reporter — but when Metropolis needs hope, he becomes Superman.<br>
      Faster than a speeding bullet, more powerful than a locomotive.

    <h4>Origin</h4>
    <p>
      Born Kal-El on the planet Krypton, he was sent to Earth as an infant. Raised by the Kents in Smallville,
